Personal Training Advisor
=========================

A solution to the 2013/14 University of Nottingham G52GUI module coursework. The coursework aim was to design and produce a Graphical User Interface for an application to aid users in keeping track of their personal fitness and diet.

The application implements these features required for the coursework:
 * Store data for Body Mass Index (BMI)
 * Record any training activities users have undertaken
 * Record diet activities over a period of time (day, week month and year)
 * Add photos or other links to their system.

Extra features include:
 * Support for multiple users
 * Profile-based data storage
 * Application preferences

The application has been developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Each component has its own Java package. The model was developed using Test Driven Development (TDD) and all tests can be found in the `pta.tests` package.
